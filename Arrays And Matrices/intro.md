# Arrays & Matrices in Java.

An array is a vector with one or more dimensions.
Usually, arrays can have maximum of 3 dimensions.
A **one dimensional** array is declared as arr[] with 0-based indexing.
A **two dimensional** array is declared as arr[][] with 0-based indexing for both the dimensions (aka. rows and columns). 
A **three dimensional** array is declared as arr[][][] with 0-based indexing for all the three dimensions.
An array with two dimensions can be considered a matrix.
