# Algorithms

This repo contains standard problems of various topics related to Algorithms.

**Time and Space Complexities** of most of the solution can be found in the commit or the code itself. Each code will have only one commit.

Codes are *clean*, *properly formatted* and *pass all the testcases*.

Topics Covered : 
1. Recursion
2. Searching and Sorting
3. Arrays and Matrices
4. Strings
5. Dynamic Programming
6. Recursion and Backtracing
7. Greedy Algorithm
