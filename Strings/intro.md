# Strings in Java
In Java, string is basically an object that represents sequence of char values. 
An array of characters works same as Java string.
Java String class provides a lot of methods to perform operations on strings such as *compare(), concat(), equals(), split(), length(), replace(), compareTo(), intern(), substring() etc.*
The java.lang.String class implements ***Serializable***, ***Comparable*** and ***CharSequence*** interfaces.
The Java String is immutable which means it cannot be changed. 
Whenever we change any string, a new instance is created. For mutable strings, you can use *StringBuffer* and *StringBuilder* classes.
